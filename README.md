# Info
Actually the main file doesn't work propely and it's not the definitive code of the new version.
In this branch i want to update you my progress with TimeTracking and Options function, so if you are not intrested or you are here for mistake, [switch to master branch](https://github.com/lilsickdude/Steam-Idle-Games/tree/master), you will found a definitive and working code.

# Changelog
- Added 'Options' button
